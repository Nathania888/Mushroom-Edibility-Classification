# 🍄 Mushroom Edibility Classification
📌 Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous, providing data-driven guidance for vegetarian foragers. Using the mushroom_cleaned dataset from Kaggle, we explore feature importance and predictive performance across multiple models to identify key traits associated with safe mushroom consumption.

Our goal is to create a reliable, interpretable, and scientifically grounded tool that supports safer mushroom foraging decisions.

# 📊 Dataset

Source: Kaggle - Mushroom Cleaned Dataset

Observations: 54,035 mushrooms

Features: 9 mushroom characteristics (cap diameter, cap shape, gill attachment, gill color, season, stem height, stem width, stem color)

Target Variable: class → 0 = Poisonous, 1 = Edible

# 🔍 Methodology
- Data Preprocessing

- Log transformation for skewed variables (stem_height, stem_width)

- Dropped original skewed variables after transformation

- Train-validation split (70% / 30%) with stratification

- No missing values detected

- Models Used

- Decision Tree Classifier

- Random Forest Classifier

- Logistic Regression

- Neural Network (MLPClassifier)

# 🌟 Key Insights for Foragers
* Stem Width: Consistently the strongest predictor of edibility.

* Gill Attachment & Color: Strongly associated with safe mushrooms.

* Stem Color: Standard stem colors (white, cream, brown) are safer indicators.

* Cap Shape: Rounded/convex caps are often linked with edible mushrooms.

* Seasonality: Certain seasons have a higher correlation with edibility.

# ⚠️ Disclaimer

While these models provide scientifically grounded guidance, mushroom foraging carries inherent risks. Always cross-reference findings with expert field guides and, when possible, consult mycologists before consumption.
